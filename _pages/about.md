Hello there!

I'm currently a Computer Science M.S. student at UC Santa Barbara and graduated from UCSB with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2023 as well. 

During my time at UCSB I've worked with the [Doherty Research Group](https://sites.chemengr.ucsb.edu/~ceweb/faculty/doherty/index.html?research.html&1) on their crystal morphology prediction software as well as done research with the [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/).

I also love playing volleyball during my free time and was a member of the [UCSB Men's Club Volleyball Team](https://www.instagram.com/ucsbmensclubvolleyball/) from 2019-2024.
